Dicentra
========

While reading through [WebKit Changesets](http://trac.webkit.org/timeline), I often:

* be frustrated with non-descriptive title (“Changeset /revision/” isn't helpful at all)
* wonder when this change will be or had been made into Chrome/Safari

Here comes Dicentra, a Chrome extension which adds such minor, but helpful bits into WebKit changeset entry.
